## What this course covers

Five lectures and five projects that take you from the intuition behind world models to a working three-model evaluation dashboard.

| # | Type | Title | Core Topics |
|---|------|-------|-------------|
| L01 | Lecture | Internal Simulation & Historical Context | Craik's mental models, predictive coding, four eras of world model evolution |
| L02 | Lecture | Observation Encoding & Latent Dynamics | VAE, CNN encoder, ELBO, GRU → MDN-RNN → RSSM |
| L03 | Lecture | Architecture Patterns, Learning Paradigms & Planning | Seven architecture families, CEM-MPC, latent Actor-Critic, TD-MPC |
| L04 | Lecture | Evaluation by World Model | FID, reward correlation, consistency loss, PSNR, horizon drift |
| L05 | Lecture | Frontier Debates | Language vs physical grounding, Bitter Lesson, AGI as a research target |
| P01 | Project | Train a VAE Encoder | Small CNN VAE on 64×64 pixels; ELBO loss curve; latent slider visualization |
| P02 | Project | Build an RSSM Dynamics Model | GRU, MDN-RNN, and RSSM compared; prior vs posterior rollout plots |
| P03 | Project | Train a Dreamer Agent | Full training loop: encoder + RSSM + latent Actor-Critic on a small pixel env |
| P04 | Project | Swap the Dynamics Backbone | Replace RSSM with a small causal Transformer (STORM-style); architecture comparison |
| P05 | Project | World Model Evaluation Dashboard | Per-model metrics side by side: FID, reward correlation, PSNR, latent drift |

You do not need to finish all theory before starting a project. Build, then come back with questions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Before submitting a pull request, read [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for the writing style rules that apply to all lecture and project files (no em dashes, no linear mermaid diagrams, no arrow-chain prose, EN/ZH sync, and others). Content that does not follow those rules will be asked to revise before merging.
